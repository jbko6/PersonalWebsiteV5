  Hey there! I'm Jonah, a second-year computer science student at the <a href="https://www.uw.edu">University of Washington</a> in Seattle.
  
  I'm interested in a wide variety of things in computer science, but right now I'm most interested in creating software that is first and foremost fun to use, and that connects people to the world around them. I like to excite and draw people out of routine to try something new.

  I attempted this aspiration with my <a href="./photobooth">15th Avenue Photobooth</a> project, which repurposed traffic cameras into a quirky photobooth available to all. Try it out on your phone!

  Currently, I am collaborating on a project to reimagine your browser's new tab. We're developing an extension that replaces that familiar page with a dashboard compiling all things you need to know. It includes content such as your assignments due soon, weather, what's on your calendar, and more, and it's all customizable! Look for that releasing sometime soon in the future.
  
  Outside of CS, I like to bike, hike, and explore the city. I'm very interested in city planning, and I'm looking to minor in Urban Planning (as well as Mathematics) at UW.

  On this website you can find my <a href="#resume">resume</a>, <a href="/about">my contact information</a>, as well as my various thoughts on urban planning, computer science, and whatever else interests me.
