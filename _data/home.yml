  Hey there! I'm Jonah, a first-year computer science student at the <a href="https://www.uw.edu">University of Washington</a> in Seattle.
  
  Since I'm a first year, I'm still exploring what interests me in computer science. 
  
  Outside of CS, I like to bike, hike, and explore the city. I'm very interested in city planning, and I'm looking to minor in Urban Planning (as well as Mathematics) at UW.

  On this website you can find my <a href="#resume">resume</a>, <a href="/about">my contact information</a>, as well as my various thoughts on urban planning, computer science, and whatever else interests me.
